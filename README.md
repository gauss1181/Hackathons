How To Win Every Hackathon (Or, Why Hackathons Aren’t About Winning)
==========

Repository for Hackathons workshop materials

It seems everybody’s doing them these days. From designers to scientists to programmers and everyone in between, people of all backgrounds are finding tremendous value (and fun!) in attending weekend-long collaborative project-building competitions. With 50+ hackathons planned for this year, there has never been a better time to get involved. Hear from veteran hackathon attendees about their experiences, insights, and tips for making the most of your hackathon experience, whether it’s your first or your fifteenth. We’ll talk about ideation, team-forming, balancing school-work and hackathons, what judges look for, what hackathons you should attend (and why), and how to maximize the learning, friend-making, and fun-having. ... and maybe even sleep.

Prerequisites:
Absolutely nothing! You don’t need to be a computer science major or even have programmed before. This talk is for everyone — from veteran hackathon hackers to curious students.
